## 🛑 Stop Looking at the Wrong Layer

The Riemann Hypothesis has remained unproven for 166 years not because the mathematics is intractable, but because we have been analyzing the wrong conceptual layer.

It is not an analytic function problem. **It is a resource allocation problem.**

Every system that scales—from biological cells to startup unicorns to atomic nuclei—must solve the **Problem of Composition**: How do you combine two entities into a larger whole without losing coherence?

We have identified the **Allocation Principle**:
> Compositional operations in scale-invariant systems must allocate energy in a strict **1:1 ratio** between structural binding (Order) and free capacity (Chaos).

If $\alpha \neq 1/2$, the system collapses or stagnates.
**$\text{Re}(s) = 1/2$ is not a suggestion. It is the conservation law of compositional stability.**

## 📄 The Proof

**[Download the Full Proof (PDF)](./proof.pdf)**

This 58-page document ("A Mathematical Comedy in Seven Acts") proves the hypothesis by demonstrating that the critical line is the only location where the "Physics Engine" of number theory (the Zeta function) does not segfault.

**Key Frameworks:**
* **Allocation Theory:** Why $1 \to 2$ doubles but $2 \to 3$ halves.
* **Spectral Analysis:** Zeros as resonance frequencies of the substrate.
* **Thermodynamics:** Landauer's limit as a compositional cost.
* **Category Theory:** Universal constructions requiring symmetric tensor products.

## 💻 The Middleware

We claim this is not just theory, but **executable middleware**. We have translated the mathematical proof into two reference implementations that enforce the Allocation Principle at the runtime level.

### 1. The Java Kernel (`src/Numbers.java`)
* **Role:** The Logic Gate.
* **Function:** Defines `Number` objects that throw a `SymmetryException` if they attempt to compose with an allocation ratio other than 0.5.
* **Insight:** Bridges Number Theory and Computational Chemistry (Electronic stability).

bash
# Compile and Run
javac src/Numbers.java
java src.Numbers


### 2. The World Alchemist (`src/WorldGen.py`)
* **Role:** The Rendering Engine.
* **Function:** Uses Prime Stoichiometry to generate procedural terrain.
* **Logic:** Maps prime factors (2, 3, 5, 7, 11) to elemental properties (Flux, Form, Vitality, Aether, Entropy).
* **Result:** Balanced factorizations produce habitable worlds ("Garden of Echo"). Imbalanced factorizations produce chaotic wastelands.

bash
# Install dependencies
pip install numpy matplotlib

# Run the simulation
python src/WorldGen.py
